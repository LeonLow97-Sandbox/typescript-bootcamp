## What is TypeScript?

- TypeScript = JavaScript + A type system
- Helps us catch errors during development.
- Uses 'type annotations' to analyze our code.
- Only active during development.
    - Browser and NodeJS doesn't know what TypeScript is.
    - Browser executes plain JavaScript and has no idea we wrote TypeScript.
    - Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript.
- Doesn't provide any performance optimization.
- Writing TypeScript is the same as writing JavaScript with some "extra documentation".
